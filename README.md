## What do we have here?
These notebooks comprise a rough workflow for digesting JPL's Tika metadata, ISI's image similarity data, and ISI's ad text data into a number of data frames, which are then slipped into some exploratory visualizations. 

I wouldn't draw any immediate conclusions from any of these graphs at present, but they should provide a roadmap for going further with the ad data, both in terms of analysis and in terms of integrating data sources.

## The notebooks
### Advertisement Text Clustering.ipynb
Takes the results of a number of searches for images on ISI's elasticsearch database and uses them to create and pickle a dataframe linking images to...
* all of the ads in which they were used
* all of th *other* images in those ads
* all of the texts of those ads
* hashed versions of the ad texts, which serves as a proxy for clustering ads with identical texts


### Extract Image Similarity Values.ipynb
Takes the image similarity values generated by ISI's image comparison system, and uses them to create and pickle a dataframe linking images to...
* the images found to be similar
* their similarity scores
* a number of other meta features

### Image Metadata Clustering.ipynb
Takes the metadata extracted by JPL's ImageCat system and creates & pickles a dataframe linking it to the corresponding metadata. The notebook also creates & pickles a dataframe of similarity scores for the images based on the metadata that they have in common.

### Three Hundred and Forty-Nine Cameras.ipynb
This notebook compiles the pickled dataframes produced by the other notebooks and uses them to generate exploratory graphs and correlation plots, looking both within the data sets and between them for connections. Not many are present, but the first step is probably cranking up the sample size to see if more representative samples could be drawn.


## Where could we take this for the next QPR?
In general, I would say that for the next QPR we should try to provide 
* *at least one* model that can meaningfully cull bad ads *or* identify good ads
* tests validating said models
* workflows for applying said models to data.

Some necessary steps for approaching this end:
